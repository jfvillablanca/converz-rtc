Installation
------------

Starting a dev environment

```console
[$] git clone git@github.com:jfvillablanca/converz-rtc.git 
[$] cd converz-rtc
[$] npm install
[$] npm run dev
```

**If you use Nix and you isolate your dev environment (like a proper Nix user)**
- Make sure flakes are enabled
- Make sure you have direnv and nix-direnv enabled
- If you have both crossed out, you can `cd` to the cloned dir and run:  

```console
[$] direnv allow
```
- Voila! No need to `nix develop`. Everytime, you enter the directory, you now have `npm` in your runtime path ðŸ˜Š
- **Note**: you still have to do the `npm install` since node_modules is not managed by the flake.
